## The Interface 

Welcome. This is not a blog. It is a **Digital Archive**, my collection of evolving notes, documentation, and active experiments. It is the public extension of my local filesystem. I am a Computer Science student at **LSPU** and an aspiring Software Engineer. This site documents my university life,  my fight against complexity, and my journey in building real-world software.
