# Active Deployments
This is the portfolio of my engineering work. I focus on C#, Python, and Web Dev, building everything from websites, desktop applications, and console-based app. 
### The Flagships 
- [[VIBE]] - An audio reactive visualizer built with React.js and Three.js.
- [[Stampede]] - A console-based chess engine made in C# for my final project in Fundamentals of Programming.
